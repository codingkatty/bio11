        <h2>Inherited Diseases</h2>
    
        <p>
            Inherited diseases are genetic disorders that are passed down from parents to their 
            children through genes. These diseases can be caused by mutations in a single gene, 
            multiple genes, or a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Below is a chart 
            summarizing some common inherited diseases, their causes, symptoms, and inheritance 
            patterns.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Understanding inherited diseases is crucial for diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling. Genetic testing can help identify carriers of genetic disorders and provide information for family planning.</p>
