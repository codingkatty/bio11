        <h2>Monohybrid Inheritance</h2>
    
        <h3>Definition of Monohybrid Inheritance</h3>
        <p>Involves inheritance of one characteristic and contrasting traits controlled by a gene.</p>
    
        <h3>Mendel's Experiments</h3>
        <p>
            Mendel worked with peas that have both female and male parts; stamens and carpels. 
            He cross-pollinated the pure-breeding pea plants by his own. The fertilised gametes 
            become seeds and the seeds are planted. He selects the simple and distinguishable 
            traits such as the colour of flowers, the stem length, seed shape, seed colour, colour 
            of pods, pod shape, and the position of flowers. He found out that the first generation 
            of offspring carries the same trait as parents. The experiments became a stepping stone 
            in the study of inheritance.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Monohybrid Inheritance</h3>
        <p>
            Studies of a pair of contrasting traits of a character. The original parents denote as P 
            generation. The result of the parental cross appeared as the F1 generation. The plants 
            of F1 generation allowed to cross-pollinate to produce the F2 generation.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Mendel's First Law (Law of Segregation)</h3>
        <p>
            A characteristic of an organism is controlled by a pair of alleles and only one of the 
            allelic pair is inherited in a gamete.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Summary of Mendel's Monohybrid Experiment</h3>
        <p>
            A characteristic inherited from a parent to the next generation is determined by a genetic 
            factor, which is known as a gene. A trait is controlled by a pair of genetic factors known 
            as alleles. A pair of alleles segregates (separates) randomly during the formation of 
            gametes. Only one allele from the pair is found in a single gamete. During fertilisation, a 
            zygote formed possesses two alleles (one allele from each parent) for a specific 
            characteristic. Fertilisation is random. Genotypic combinations which are homozygous 
            dominant show the dominant trait, whereas homozygous recessive shows the recessive trait. 
            Heterozygous genotype (combination of one dominant allele and one recessive allele) shows 
            the dominant trait.

        <h2>Dihybrid Inheritance</h2>
    
        <h3>Definition of Dihybrid Cross</h3>
        <p>Involves inheritance of two characteristics, each characteristic is controlled by a different gene located at a different locus.</p>
    
        <h3>Dihybrid Inheritance of Characteristics: Seed Shape and Colour Seed of Pea Plant</h3>
        <p>
            The diagram below shows a schematic diagram of a dihybrid inheritance between two purebred 
            parents to study the characteristics of pea, namely seed colour and seed shape.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two purebred parents either have a pair of homozygous dominant alleles or a pair of 
            homozygous recessive alleles. Fertilisation between the two purebred parents produces 
            offspring in the F1 generation with the dominant traits of round and yellow seeds.

                The first section states that there are two types of human chromosomes: autosomes and 
                sex chromosomes.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second section explains that human somatic cells consist of 44 autosomes and 2 sex 
                chromosomes.
            </li>
            <li>The third section mentions that autosomes vary in terms of size and length.</li>

        <h3>Changes in Number of Chromosomes</h3>
        <p>Changes in the number of chromosomes can occur due to failure of homologous chromosomes to separate during anaphase I or failure of sister chromatids to separate during anaphase II. This disorder is known as nondisjunction, which can occur in some chromosomes. When nondisjunction occurs in humans, either male gamete (sperm) or female gamete (ovum) can possess a chromosome number of less than 23 (22) or more than 23 (24).</p>
        <p>Therefore, fertilisation that involves the abnormal gamete with a normal gamete produces a zygote with 45 chromosomes or 47 chromosomes.</p>
        <p>Examples of genetic diseases caused by nondisjunction are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Down Syndrome:</strong> Also known as trisomy 21. Total chromosome number is 47 (45 + XY). There is an extra chromosome for chromosome pair number 21. Down syndrome can occur in both males and females.</li>
            <li><strong>Turner Syndrome:</strong> Total number of chromosomes is 45 (44 + XO). There is a missing X chromosome in the pair of sex chromosomes. The gender of an individual with Turner syndrome is female.</li>
            <li><strong>Klinefelter Syndrome:</strong> Karyotype of Klinefelter syndrome has a total of 47 chromosomes (44 + XXY). There is an extra X chromosome in the pair of sex chromosomes. The gender of an individual with Klinefelter syndrome is male; however, his secondary sex characteristics are not well-developed.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Human Inheritance</h3>
        <h4>ABO Blood Groups</h4>
        <p>Controlled by three different alleles of a single gene called <em>I</em> gene: <em>I<sub>A</sub></em> (dominant), <em>I<sub>B</sub></em> (dominant), and <em>I<sub>O</sub></em> (recessive). There are six possible genotypes and four possible phenotypes.</p>
        <p>Blood group AB is a universal recipient because it does not contain any antibodies. Blood group O is a universal donor because it does not contain antigens on the surface of the cell. Antibodies are unable to bind on the surface of the cell without antigens and vice versa, which prevents blood agglutination.</p>

        <h4>Rhesus Factor (Rh)</h4>
        <p>Another antigen that presents on the surface of the red blood cell that affects blood compatibility. Blood agglutination occurs when an individual with an antigen reacts with the antibodies from individuals without this antigen. Controlled by a pair of alleles: Rh-allele (dominant) and rh-allele (recessive).</p>
        <p>Rhesus positive (Rh+) individuals: <em>Rh-Rh</em> or <em>Rh-rh</em>. Rhesus negative (Rh-) individuals: <em>rh-rh</em>.</p>
        <p>Rhesus factor can be a problem when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Rh- person receives Rh+ blood during blood transfusion because the recipient‚Äôs blood reacts by producing rhesus antibodies, causing blood agglutination.</li>
            <li>A Rh- mother carries another Rh+ baby in the second pregnancy, which can cause miscarriage because the mother already contains rhesus antibodies that attack the Rh+ baby from the first pregnancy.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Sex Determination</h3>
        <p>Normal autosomes (somatic cells) in males and females are 44 (22 pairs). Normal sex chromosomes in males and females are XY and XX respectively. This makes the number of chromosomes in humans 44 + XY (46) or 44 + XX (46).</p>
        <p>However, the cells of an individual with a genetic disease show a different number of chromosomes than a normal being.</p>
    
        <h3>Sex-Linked Inheritance</h3>
        <p>Sex chromosomes also carry genes for other traits other than determining sex. Sex-linked genes refer to the genes carried on the X chromosome (which contains a longer segment than the Y chromosome). Thus, in a male, any trait caused by a dominant or recessive allele present on the X chromosome will be manifested fully because males contain one X chromosome.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Haemophilia:</strong> Blood unable to clot normally; caused by a recessive allele on the X chromosome.</li>
            <li><strong>Colour Blindness:</strong> Unable to differentiate between certain colours; caused by a recessive allele on the X chromosome.</li>

        <h3>Ability to Roll Tongue and Types of Earlobe</h3>
        <p>The ability to roll the tongue and the types of earlobes are two characteristics that can be inherited from parents to children according to Mendel‚Äôs Law. The ability to roll the tongue is a dominant trait. Free earlobe is a dominant trait whereas attached earlobe is a recessive trait.</p>
    
        <h3>Family Pedigree</h3>
        <p>Family pedigree or lineage can be analysed to investigate the inheritance of human characteristics. Family pedigree is a flowchart through a few generations to show ancestral relationships and the inheritance of characteristics from ancestors to individuals in the present generation.</p>
        <p>Analysis of family pedigree enables geneticists to predict an inherited characteristic of interest and also to identify the features of dominant or recessive genes. Normally, a dominant gene appears in every generation whereas a recessive gene is probably hidden in certain generations.</p>
